SUMMARY:GRMN011301
DESCRIPTION:"Beauty is not a quality inherent to things: it only exists i
 n the mind of the beholder." (David Hume) "Taste classifies\, and it cla
 ssifies the classifier." (Pierre Bourdieu) "Kitsch causes two tears to f
 low in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children o
 n the grass. The second tear says: How nice to be moved\, together with 
 all mankind\, by children running on the grass! The second tear makes ki
 tsch kitsch." (Milan Kundera) Most of us can recognize bad taste as soon
  as we see it: Harlequin romances\, Elvis on black velvet\, lawn ornamen
 ts. But bad taste also has a history\, and kitsch has been identified as
  a peculiarly modern invention related to capitalism and consumerism. Be
 ginning with a discussion of taste in the eighteenth century (Hume\, Kan
 t)\, we will investigate under what conditions good taste can go bad\, f
 or example when it is the object of mass reproduction\, and\, on the oth
 er hand\, why bad taste in recent times has increasingly been recuperate
 d as an art form. Categories such as the cute\, the sentimental\, the mi
 niature\, kitsch\, and camp will be explored. We will also ask what form
 s of ideological work have been done by this brand of aesthetics\, for e
 xample in the connection between politics and kitsch\, feminity and the 
 low-brow\, or camp and queer identity.

SUMMARY:GRMN101002
DESCRIPTION:Designed for the beginning student with no previous knowledge
  of German. German 101\, as the first course in the first-year series\, 
 focuses on the development of language competence in listening\, speakin
 g\, reading\, and writing. By the end of the semester\, students will be
  able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things\, know gre
 etings and everyday expressions\, they will be ble to count and tell tim
 e\, and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore\, students 
 will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past a
 nd express plans for the future. In addition\, students will have develo
 ped reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple 
 newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultur
 al knowledge is one of the foci of German 101\, students will learn much
  about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultur
 es on the Internet.
