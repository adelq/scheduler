SUMMARY:PSCI181001
DESCRIPTION:This course will provide an overview of major figures and the
 mes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions p
 ertinent to political theory in the modern era\, particularly focusing o
 n the relationship of the individual to community\, society\, and state.
  Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral\, political
 \, and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras\, it is in the
  seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state\, pol
 itical institutions\, moral thinking\, and social relations. The central
 ity of "the individual" has created difficulties\, even paradoxes\, for 
 community and social relations\, and political theorists have struggled 
 to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the polit
 ical forms that emerged out of those struggles\, as well as the changed 
 and distinctly "modern" conceptualizations of political theory such as f
 reedom\, responsibilty\, justice\, rights and obligations\, as central c
 ategories for organizing moral and political life.
