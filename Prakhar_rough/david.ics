SUMMARY:CINE101401
DESCRIPTION:This course surveys the history of world film from cinema s p
 recursors to 1945. We will develop methods for analyzing film while exam
 ining the growth of film as an art\, an industry\, a technology\, and a 
 political instrument. Topics include the emergence of film technology an
 d early film audiences\, the rise of narrative film and birth of Hollywo
 od\, national film industries and movements\, African-American independe
 nt film\, the emergence of the genre film (the western\, film noir\, and
  romantic comedies)\, ethnographic and documentary film\, animated films
 \, censorship\, the MPPDA and Hays Code\, and the introduction of sound.
  We will conclude with the transformation of several film industries int
 o propaganda tools during World War II (including the Nazi\, Soviet\, an
 d US film industries). In addition to contemporary theories that investi
 gate the development of cinema and visual culture during the first half 
 of the 20th century\, we will read key texts that contributed to the eme
 rgence of film theory. There are no prerequisites. Students are required
  to attend screenings or watch films on their own.

SUMMARY:CIS 120001
DESCRIPTION:A fast-paced introduction to the fundamental concepts of prog
 ramming and software design. This course assumes some previous programmi
 ng experience\, at the level of a high school computer science class or 
 CIS110. (If you got at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam\,
  you will do great.) No specific programming language background is assu
 med: basic experience with any language (for instance Java\, C\, C++\, V
 B\, Python\, Perl\, or Scheme) is fine. If you have never programmed bef
 ore\, you should take CIS 110 first.
