SUMMARY:BIOL121001
DESCRIPTION:An intensive introductory lecture course covering the cell\, 
 molecular biology\, biochemistry\, and the genetics of animals\, bacteri
 a\, and viruses. This course is comparable to Biology 101\, but places g
 reater emphasis on molecular mechanisms and experimental approaches. Par
 ticular attention is given to the ways in which modern cell biological a
 nd molecular genetic methods contribute to our understanding of evolutio
 nary processes\, the mechanistic basis of human disease\, and recent bio
 technological innovations. Students are encouraged to take BIOL 121 and 
 123 concurrently.

SUMMARY:CIS 120001
DESCRIPTION:A fast-paced introduction to the fundamental concepts of prog
 ramming and software design. This course assumes some previous programmi
 ng experience\, at the level of a high school computer science class or 
 CIS110. (If you got at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam\,
  you will do great.) No specific programming language background is assu
 med: basic experience with any language (for instance Java\, C\, C++\, V
 B\, Python\, Perl\, or Scheme) is fine. If you have never programmed bef
 ore\, you should take CIS 110 first.

SUMMARY:HSOC052301
DESCRIPTION:The CDC estimates that 1 in 150 children have autism. Three d
 ecades ago\, this number was 1 in 5\,000. The communities in which these
  children are identified in ever increasing numbers are ill prepared to 
 meet their needs. Scientists have struggled to understand the causes of 
 this disorder\, its treatment\, and why it appears to be rapidly increas
 ing. Families\, policy makers\, schools and the healthcare system have a
 rgued bitterly in the press and in the courts about the best way to cre 
 for these children and the best ways to pay for this care. In this class
 \, we will use autism as a case study to understnad how psychiatric and 
 developmental disorders of childhood come to be defined over time\, thei
 r biologocal and environmental causes identified\, and treatments develo
 ped. We will also discuss the identification and care of these children 
 in the broader context of the American education and healthcare systems.
